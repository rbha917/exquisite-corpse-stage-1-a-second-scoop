## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*This sketch represents an unconventional passing of time through a random flavoured scoop of ice cream being added onto an ice cream cone each second. The title is a play on words because the phrase would mean asking for a second scoop of ice cream on a cone when this is adding a scoop of ice cream to the cone every second. The ice cream cone refreshes when the scoop tower reaches a point where it would overflow the page if another scoop were to be added. I wanted to show how more of something can be accumulated through the passing of time until it reaches a point where there can be no more and must build up from the bottom again.*
