## Briefs for each stage

### 游댮 Stage 1
Create a sketch that shows an unconventional representation of time. This 'clock' should be constantly changing, but its appearance can repeat in a subsequent cycle. It does not need to follow a 24-hour cycle (you can use any timescale). Give your sketch a unique title and edit the README file accordingly.

### 游리 Stage 2
Respond to a Stage 1 sketch that you've chosen by using interactivity. You can either add to the chosen sketch or build a new one from scratch (this applies for all subsequent stages too).

### 游릭 Stage 3
Find or construct a dataset that relates to the sketch you've inherited. Incorporate visualisations of the dataset into your response to the Stage 2 sketch.

### 游댯 Stage 4
Adapt a Stage 3 sketch into a text-based game. There should be different pathways through the game. Images (still or moving) can accompany the words (but this is not required).

### 游릮 Stage 5
Reimagine something from a Stage 4 sketch as a living entity or an environment.

*This sketch represents an unconventional passing of time through a random flavoured scoop of ice cream being added onto an ice cream cone each second. The title is a play on words because the phrase would mean asking for a second scoop of ice cream on a cone when this is adding a scoop of ice cream to the cone every second. I have imposed a limit so that when the ice cream tower approaches the top of the canvas, it will start over. I wanted to show how more of something can be accumulated through the passing of time until it reaches a limit and then must be rebuilt from the bottom again. The reason for putting this in a repeating cycle is because of how I view time.  Time is an endless loop while everything else is finite; things will rise, then fall and have to rebuild, but time will keep going. You can only have so much of something before its goes or you do, either one, but then the cycle will start again with someone or something new. It's a metaphor that can be applied to so many different contexts from life itself to a relationship, a job/project or even status and wealth, really anything that can progress through time until it has run its course. I wanted to communicate this idea in a way that appears to be simple and lighthearted disguising the deeper underlying meaning. This is how I ended up with a looping ice cream cone which looks like fun and games until you realise that it is stuck on repeat. The random scoop colours represent change and the unpredictability of circumstances through time because you never know what's going to happen in the next second, minute or year. I have used a dark grey background to allow the ice cream scoops to pop but also not look too harsh as they would against a pure black background and placed the ice cream in the centre of the canvas to draw in the user's focus.*
